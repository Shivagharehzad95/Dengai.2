# ðŸ§¿ DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread

This repository contains experiments and results from our participation in the [DengAI competition on DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/).
The goal is to predict the number of dengue fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos using environmental and climate data.
Our repo is a 3-day exploration of this data, building a pipeline to process, analyze, and build a model for predictions that outputs CSV we could submit to the competition.

1227th of 16,349 participants (MAE of 25.0409), we still have a long way to go, but we learned a lot about feature engineering and model selections and their limitations and also how to organize a codebase for the given use case. We have plans to improve and refactor in the near future.
